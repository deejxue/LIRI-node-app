# LIRI-node-app

LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a _Language_ Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.

(FYI for the programmer....
  1. LIRI will display your latest tweets. (please make an alias account and add a few tweets to it!)

  2. To retrieve the data that will power this app, you'll need to send requests to the Twitter, Spotify and OMDB APIs. 
  You'll find these Node packages crucial for your assignment.
